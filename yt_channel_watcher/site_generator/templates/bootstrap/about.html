            This is a fan made website. The site only tracks my own taste of channels.<br>
            You can't browse older videos or members-only content on this site. Please use YouTube for that.

            yt-channel-watcher is a program that call <a class="ytcw-text-blue-500"
                href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yt-dlp</a> to fetch
            channels
            informations (videos&shorts) and then generate a static HTML from the video data.<br>
            I really liked the <a class="ytcw-text-blue-500" href="https://holodex.net/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">holodex</a>
            project, but it only/mostly tracks vtuber clippers. I
            just wanted to see the vtubers' own content.<br>
            This project is not limited to just to the vtuber community, you can use it to fetch any youtube channel.
